**Aegolius** is the public repository for the Python package **SPOMSO**.

**SPOMSO** is a free and open-source Python package, used to procedurally construct geometry on the foundation of [Signed Distance Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function) (SDFs).

## Key Features

-   **Free and open-source software** under the [GNU LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).
-   Geometry can be defined in **2D** and **3D**.
-   Object-oriented and function-oriented approach to defining geometry, with 11 pre-defined 2D objects and 20 pre-defined 3D objects.
-   Built-in [Euclidian Transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation) (translation, rotation, scaling)
-   In total 26 possible modifications, including:
    * extrusion, revolution, twist, bend, elongation
    * mirror, symmetry, rotational symmetry
    * finite and infinite instancing
    * instancing along lines, segmented lines and parametric curves
    * surface-to-volume and volume-to-surface operations
-   In total 11 ways to combine different geometric objects together - different implementations of:
    * union, intersection, subtraction
    * smooth union, smooth intersection, smooth subtraction


## Examples

In total there are 26 examples showing how to construct geometry and use many of the features included in SPOMSO.
For each of the examples there is both a *python script (.py)* version and an *interactive python notebook (.ipynb)* version.

## Future developments

In the future it will be possible to run the code on a GPU from within Python, with support for [Automatic Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
